A local group is planning a protest tomorrow in opposition to the United Nation's Climate Change Conference in Cancun.
The group, Americans for Prosperity-Colorado, will be meeting at the Retired Enlisted Associated at 834 Emory Circle in the Springs at 6 p.m. to protest "alarmism" about global warming, and its cost to taxpayers.
Called the Hot Air Tour, the group is also planning protests in Grand Junction and Loveland.
"Coloradoans are fed up with the Washington bureaucrats that are trying to run our lives with their plan to regulate carbon emissions," said AFP Colorado State Director Jeff Crank. "Many Coloradoans are hurting economically and can't afford to pay higher prices for food and gas while bureaucrats fly around the world to dictate their agenda. "
The group will broadcast a Webcast featuring AFP President Tim Phillips.
