Earth Day is April 22. Recently, some scientists have started calling climate change the “climate change emergency” or the “climate change crisis” because of the disastrous effects climate change could have. Also, in 2020, there were worldwide demonstrations by students who wanted more done to address climate change
An excuse that some politicians have given for not doing more to address climate change is that it would cost jobs. Switching to renewable energy will cost jobs in the fossil fuel industry but create clean energy jobs. Another excuse is that switching to clean energy could make energy more expensive for low-income people. I’m affiliated with the Citizens Climate Lobby which advocates a fee on carbon emissions and a monthly dividend to return the fees collected to the American People. Low-income people have a low carbon foot so their dividend would exceed their extra cost of energy.
A National Geographic magazine article about young people taking the lead in fighting climate change quotes a student as saying, “It is incredible that kindergartners can grasp this as a problem and politicians can’t”.
It’s time for all politicians to listen to what scientists and young people are saying and take immediate and decisive action to address climate change.
