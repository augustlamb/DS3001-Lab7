Oct. 26â€”The N.H. Sierra Club has endorsed a host of candidates for state office, including several running to represent area towns.

In a prepared statement, Political Committee Chair Jim Allmendinger stressed the importance of halting climate change.

"So much is at stake, here in New Hampshire and elsewhere," he said. "Our waters, our air and our future do not allow for any delay in bringing clean, carbon-neutral energy into reality. Rising seas, rising temperatures, and melting glaciers are no respecters of vetoes from Governor Sununu. We need a governor and a legislature that will act and act for the good of us all."
